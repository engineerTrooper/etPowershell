# etPowerShell

is a collection of PowerShell scripts to optimize, get information or automize tasks on a windows machine. Later also network and remote stuff on windows machines. 

Linux is not in scope right now, because bash is I think a way better option on linux machines. But if you use powershell on linux, feel free to start a discussion with an issue or give feedback.

## Scripts Description

### systemCheck.ps1
Is a collection of methods and functions to give a full overview of the machine, where it is executed. The script can take between 1 to 3 minutes to get all information ready. Make sure the destination directory exists on your system to save the report files!
